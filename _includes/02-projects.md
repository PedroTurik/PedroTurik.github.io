# Personal Projects 
This is a non-exhaustive list of some personal projects I managed to put together in my free time and actually finish. All of them were made for studying porpuses.

### [Loxide](https://github.com/PedroTurik/lox-rs)
A fast **Rust** implementation of the **Lox Language** (see [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)). Heavily inspired by the books design, but many changes were made to avoid unecessary dynamic dispatch and other indirections. This project was the most fun to do out of all

### [Smart Finder](https://github.com/PedroTurik/SmartFinder)
A **Pygame** project that showcases some common *Search Algorithms* in a very simple interface that allows the creation of walls, and random generation of a Maze.

### [CDASS Plataform](https://github.com/PedroTurik/CdassWebProject)
**CDASS** stands for *Clube de Algoritmo Sociedade Secreta* (*Algorithms Club Secret Society*), which was a extra curricular activity focused on competitive programming in my university that I used to be manage, create challenges and build infrastracture for. Although I am not there anymore, this plataform is still in use. Its a very basic webite made with **SvelteKit** (*using Typescript*), deployed in **Vercel**, that uses **Firebase** for Auth and data persistence. Its functionality is also very simple. It allowed students to see the challenges, separated by the degree of difficulty, and answer them if they were authenticated. It also handled the ranking system for different student capabilities, and a very simples admin interface for admin users to add content.

### [Snake Game](https://github.com/PedroTurik/Snake_Game)
A Terminal based snake game implemented in **Rust**.... thats all

### [Scitek Datathon](https://github.com/PedroTurik/Competitions/tree/main/SciTek_datathon)
A data analysis I made for a Data Science Hackathon I won in 2022. It interprets data from a football videos database to determine the frequency of certain events during the course of the match
