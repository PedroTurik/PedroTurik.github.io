# Personal Projects 
This is a non-exhaustive list of some personal projects I managed to put together in my free time and actually finish. All of them were made for studying porpuses.

### [Loxide](https://github.com/PedroTurik/lox-rs)
A fast **Rust** implementation of the **Lox Language** (see [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)). Heavily inspired by the books design, but many changes were made to avoid unecessary dynamic dispatch and other indirections. This project was the most fun to do out of all

### [Smart Finder](https://github.com/PedroTurik/SmartFinder)
A **Pygame** project that showcases some common *Search Algorithms* in a very simple interface that allows the creation of walls, and random generation of a Maze.

### [CDASS Plataform](https://github.com/PedroTurik/CdassWebProject)
**CDASS** stands for *Clube de Algoritmo Sociedade Secreta* (*Algorithms Club Secret Society*), which was an extra curricular activity focused on competitive programming in my university that I used to manage, create challenges and build infrastracture for. Although I am not there anymore, this plataform is still in use. It's a very basic webite made with **SvelteKit** (*using Typescript*), deployed in **Vercel**, that uses **Firebase** for Auth and data persistence.

### [Snake Game](https://github.com/PedroTurik/Snake_Game)
A terminal based snake game implemented in **Rust**.... thats all

### [Scitek Datathon](https://github.com/PedroTurik/Competitions/tree/main/SciTek_datathon)
A data analysis I made for a Data Science Hackathon I won in 2022. It interprets data from a football videos database to determine the frequency of certain events during the course of the match
